Dear Loan Servicing Team,

Due to a recent job loss, I’m struggling to meet the current payment terms for my loan #33445. I’d like to request a modification to lower my monthly payments. My current payment is USD 3,000.00, and I’d like to reduce it to USD 1,500.00. Please advise on the process.

Sincerely,
David Lee
