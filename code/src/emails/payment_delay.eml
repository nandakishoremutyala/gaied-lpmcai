Dear Loan Team,

I am writing to inform you that I will be unable to make my loan payment of USD 2,000.00 due on 20-Mar-2025 for loan #67890. Iâ€™ve recently faced some financial challenges and would like to request a 30-day extension. Please let me know the process to apply for this delay.

Sincerely,
Sarah Connor
